How it works
Paste in source text from material you type a lot, e.g. if you're a medical typist you might paste in 50 Cardiology letters.
Click Start and the generator will extract the most common sequences of text from the material you provided. Use this information to populate your text expander.
Pre Processing:
Most special characters are removed
Apostrophes are removed
Carriage returns are removed
Dashes are replaced with spaces
Post Processing:
Results that are less than 7 characters long are excluded*
Sequences that only occur once are excluded
Sub-sequences of larger sequences are excluded**
*We don't include short results as there's little or no benefit in automating something that's just as quick to type manually
**We don't show you that "ipsum dolor" occurs three times, if it's already included in the larger sequence "Lorem ipsum dolor set". The exception to this rule is when the sub-sequence occurs more often than the larger sequence, meaning it exists elsewhere in the text and should be considered its own entity.
